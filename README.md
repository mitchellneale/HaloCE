## Objective and Intent

This project was created as a simple challenge to learn and practice svelte.

## Tools & Technologies
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- [ESLint](http://eslint.org/) - for linting JavaScript
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) - for formatting code
- [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) - for building the front-end
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) - for hosting and deployment
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)


## Getting Started

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm init svelte

# create a new project in my-app
npm init svelte my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
